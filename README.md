# Gonpachiro

The final project for Introduction to Programming / Program Design Methods

2020/2021

> And yeah, you guessed it. The name of this project is taken from the infamous anime of this year (2020), Demon Slayer.

### What is Gonpachiro?

This Gonpachiro has no relation with the original Gonpachiro from Demon Slayer, this Gonpachiro is a virtual assistant
program written in Python, as you can see on the right side of this note. 

### Features (as of 29th December 2020)

1. Define something
2. Give short description of known people
3. Make lists and notes
4. Open user-installed apps
5. Search the web
6. Telling current weather of a city
7. Telling jokes
8. Voice commands
9. User interface

### Current state

This project is unfinished. Minor updates will come later when the feature has been implemented (marked with WIP in
the features list). I don't plan to continue adding features too (might change my mind later. If ever I don't have anything
to do, maybe I'll try implementing more stuff into Gonpachiro).

### Bugs

- Defining something can sometimes be buggy, as it gives the explanation on other language other than English, depends
on the user's locale language. The same bug goes for giving description of someone.
  
- Before Gonpachiro has finished talking, the GUI will be frozen. I'll try to fix this later if time and luck can cooperate.

### Important Note

If someone somehow finds this and wants to clone this repo, Gonpachiro only works on Windows. If you met the first requirement
(you're using Windows), please move or copy the 'Gonpachiro' folder to the C:/ drive (the C:/ itself, don't put it on any folder). 
This program was made on Windows 10 and uses file modifications, 
so all the files and folders necessary for this program to run is referenced to Windows 10. If you're using an older version,
feel free to try it. Important note is that I haven't tested this on the older version of Windows, so the program may not work
correctly (especially on first launch), you may get blank user profile image on the top right of the GUI.

```
WIP (ignore)

- weather icons
- usr img on start
- threading (if can lol, gave up with the alarm); voice and gui work together
- open app
