# Wolf

The final project for Introduction to Programming / Program Design Methods<br/>
2020/2021

### What is Wolf?

Wolf is a virtual assistant program written in Python, as you can see on the right side of this note.
Wolf also features user interface. User can customize some of Wolf's features such as their name,
their preffered background color, and their profile picture.

### Features (as of 31st December 2020)

1. Define something
2. Give short description of known people
3. Make lists and notes
4. Open user-installed apps
5. Search the web (multiple search engines)
6. Telling current weather of a city
7. Telling jokes
8. Voice commands
9. User interface
10. Play video on YouTube & music on YT Music based on user search

### Current state

This project is unfinished. Minor updates will come later when the feature has been implemented (you can
read on the bottommost of this note). I don't plan to continue adding features too (might change my mind later.
If ever I don't have anything to do, maybe I'll try implementing more stuff into Wolf).

### Bugs

- Defining something can sometimes be buggy, as it gives the explanation on other language other than English, depends
on the user's locale language. The same bug goes for giving description of someone.
  
- Before Wolf has finished talking, the GUI will be frozen. I'll try to fix this later if time and luck can cooperate.

### Important Note

If someone somehow finds this and wants to clone this repo, Gonpachiro only works on Windows. If you met the first requirement
(you're using Windows), please move or copy the 'Wolf' folder to the C:/ drive (the C:/ itself, don't put it on any folder). 
This program was made on Windows 10 and uses file modifications, 
so all the files and folders necessary for this program to run is referenced to Windows 10. If you're using an older version,
feel free to try it. Important note is that I haven't tested this on the older version of Windows, so the program may not work
correctly (especially on first launch), you may get blank user profile image on the top right of the GUI.
